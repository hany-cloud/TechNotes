================================================================================================================================================
Is Java a pure object-oriented language? if not why? No
	There are many things you can do without objects e.g. static methods. Also, primitive variables are not objects in Java.


Method signature: means the number and type of arguments.


What are the rules of method overloading and overriding in Java?
		Method overloading: the method signature should be different i.e. either the number of arguments or the type of arguments. 
							Simply changing the return type of two methods will not result in overloading, 
							instead, the compiler will throw an error. 
		On the other hand, 
		Method overriding: has more rules e.g. name and return type must be the same, method signature should also be the same, 
						   the overloaded method cannot throw a higher checked exception.


	The difference between method overloading and overriding?
		Method overloading is resolved at compile-time. 
		Method overriding is resolved at runtime. 
		The compiler only used the class information for method overloading, but it needs to know the object (reference variable of type superclass/subclass) 
		to resolve overridden method calls.

	What is the difference between Polymorphism, Overloading, and Overriding?
		Polymorphism is the real concept behind on both Overloading and Overriding. 
		Overloading is compiled time Polymorphism and Overriding is Runtime Polymorphism.


	Can we overload a static method in Java? Yes
	Can we override the static method in Java? No
		No, you cannot override a static method because it's not bounded to an object. Instead, 
		static methods belong to a class and resolved at compile time using the type of reference variable. 
		But, Yes, you can declare the same static method in a subclass, that will result in method hiding 
		i.e. if you use the reference variable of type subclass then new method will be called, 
		but if you use the reference variable of type superclass then old method will be called.
		
	Can we prevent overriding a method without using the final modifier? Yes, By marking the method private or static	

	Can we override a private method in Java? No,But, you can override them inside the inner class as they are accessible there.
	******Tricky
			public class Parent {
				private void overridedMethod() {
					System.out.println("Parent private method is called!!!");
				}
				
				class InnerChild extends Parent {
					private void method() {
						System.out.println("InnerChild private method is called!!!");
					}
				}
				
				public static void main(String[] args) {
					Parent p = new Parent();
					Parent.InnerChild innerChild = p.new InnerChild();
						--------------	
					innerChild.method(); // w/o Parent.InnerChild, it will call the parent method
								
					Parent child = new Child(1); // Child is another class extends Parent class
					child.overridedMethod(); // will call always the parent method, because the parent method is declared private method 			
				}
			}
	
	What is the Covariant method overriding in Java? OR 
	Can we change the return type of method to subclass while overriding?
			the overriding method can return the subclass of the object returned by the original or overridden method. 
			It's very helpful in case the original method is returning general type like Object class, because, 
			then by using the covariant method overriding you can return a more suitable object and prevent client-side typecasting. 
			One of the practical use of this concept is when you override the "clone()" method in Java.
			
	Can we change the argument list of an overriding method? No
	Can we override a method that throws runtime exception without throws clause? Yes
		But in the case of checked exception, an overriding exception cannot throw a checked exception which comes higher in type hierarchy 
		e.g. if the original method is throwing IOException than the overriding method cannot throw java.lang.Exception or java.lang.Throwable.
	How do you call a superclass version of an overriding method in a subclass? Using super keyword.
	
	*****Can we Reducing the visibility by access modifiers for overriding method? 
		No, Cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method from Parent class (it will give a compiler error)
		i.e if the overridden method in Parent class is declared as "public", the overriding method cannot be protected, default, or private.
	
	Can we override the final method in Java? No, 
		You use the final when you don't want subclass changing the logic of your method by overriding it due to Immutability, or Security reasons. 
		This is why the "String" class is final in Java. 
		This concept is also used in the "Template Design Pattern" where the template method is made final to prevent overriding.

	
	****TRICKY****
	Can we override a non-static method as static in Java? No, (it will give a compiler error)
	
		
What are differences between Abstract class and Interface?
	Both are there to specify the contract of an API and to support the OOP "Abstraction" Concept as they define only abstract behavior 
	and will tell that your program will give output but how is left to implementors.
	
	And since both of them need to be extended or implemented, so you can accomplish the "Polymorphism" OOP concept using both of them.
	Althogh both of them can exist without declaring any abstract methods.
	
	The key defirences espicially after Java8, are the constructors and variables declaration
	constructors can be introduced only in Abstract classes
	And variables by default are public, static, and final in the interface.
	
	Constructor Chain
		Once you have constructors declared in parent and child classes, you have to call the parent constructor from one of the child constructors.
				// Wrong Code
				protected int var1;
				Parent(int var1) {
					this.var1 = var1;
				}
				Parent() {										Parent() {			
					super(2);										this(2); 
					this(2); // complie error						super(2); // complie error, TOO
				}												}
				
				// Coorect Code
				protected int var1;
				Parent(int var1) {
					super(1);
					this.var1 = var1;
				}
				
				Parent() {
					this(2);		
				}

Can an interface extend more than one interface in Java? Yes, an interface can extend more than one interface

																OOP Design 
															Design Principle (SOLID)
														-------------------------------
================================================================================================================================================
OOP Design
-----------	
	What is the difference between Association, Aggregation, and Composition in OOP?
		When an object is related to another object is called association. 
		It has two forms, aggregation, and composition. 
		Aggregation is the loose form of Association where the related object can survive individually. 
		while Composition is a stronger form of Association where a related object cannot survive individually. 
		For example, the "city" is an Aggregation of "people" but "people" is the Composition of "body parts".

	What is the difference between Composition and Inheritance in OOP?
		Both of them are very important from a class design perspective. Though both Composition and Inheritance allows you to reuse code, 
		formerly Composition is more flexible than later. Composition allows the class to get an additional feature at runtime, 
		but Inheritance is static. You can not change the feature at runtime by substitution of a new implementation.
		
	What is the difference between Abstraction and Polymorphism in OOP and Java?
		Abstraction generalizes the concept 
			Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user. Оnly the functionality will be provided to the user. 
			In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
		Polymorphism allows you to use different implementation without changing your code.
			Or by other mean is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
			Polymorphism occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
	
	What is Encapsulation in OOP and Java? 
		The variables and Methods of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. 
		Therefore, it is also known as data hiding. 
		Such as declaring the variables of a class as private. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
		And in design we always aim to "Encapsulate What Changes".	


Object-Oriented Design Principles
----------------------------------
	1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
		Means don't write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place.
		Although It means if you used standard code to validate OrderID and SSN, you tightly couple them forever, while they are different in nature.

	2. Encapsulate What Changes
		Means encapsulate the code you expect or suspect to be changed in the future. 
		The benefit is, It's easy to test and maintain proper the encapsulated code.
		
		You can apply this priciple in Java 
		By making variable and methods private by default and increasing access step by step, e.g. from private to protected and not public.

		> The Factory design pattern is one example of Encapsulation which encapsulates object creation code.
	
	3. Open Closed Design Principle ("O" In SOLID)
		Means Classes, methods, or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification.
		This prevents someone from changing already tried and tested code.
		
		> The Strategy design Pattern is one example of Open Closed Design principle.
		> The State design Pattern
		> The Decorator design Pattern is also another example of Open Closed Design principle.
		> The Template Method design Pattern.
	
	4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ("S" In SOLID)
		Means there should not be more than one reason for a class, or a class should always handle single functionality.
		If you put more than one functionality in one Class, it introduces coupling between two functionality, 
			and even if you change one feature, there is a chance you broke coupled functionality, which requires another round of testing.

	5. Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control(IOC) principle ("D" In SOLID)
		1) Reduce coupling		2) Improves testability				3) Flexibility (you can replace non-performance implementation with a better one later)

		Means Don't ask for dependency; it will be provided to you by the framework. This has been very well implemented in Spring framework, 
		the beauty of this design principle is that any class which is injected by DI framework is easy to test 
		with the mock object and more comfortable to maintain because object creation code is centralized in the framework and client code 
		is not littered with that.

		There are multiple ways to implement Dependency injection like using bytecode instrumentation, which some AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) 
		framework like AspectJ does or by using proxies just like used in Spring.
		
		One of the implementations of DI is Inversion of Control (IOC) on which framework like Spring controls object’s dependency.
		
		There are mainly two types of Dependency Injection: Constructor Injection and Setter Injection.	
		Both have there pros and cons. Constructor DI allows the object to be created in complete state and follows the principle of the fully functional object 
		while Setter DI allows object to be created without its dependency. which may result in an incomplete object if dependency is not available.

		DI in Use
		----------
		public class AuditServiceImpl implements AuditService{

			private IAuditDAO auditDao; // IAuditDAO is prefered to be interface or abstract class

			public void setAuditDao(IAuditDAO AuditDao) {
				this.AuditDao = AuditDao;
			}
		 
			@Override
			public boolean audit (String message) {
			   return auditDao.store(message);
			}
		 
		}
		Benefits:
		1. Since AuditDAO is injected here its possible to share single AuditDAO (an expensive object) between multiple AuditService.
		2. Since AuditServiceImpl is not creating an instance of AuditDAO its no more coupled with AuditDAO and works with any implementation of AuditDAO, 
		   thanks to another famous object-oriented design principle “Program For Interface than Implementation".
		3. Because AuditDAO is injected by DI at runtime it's easy to test audit() method by providing a mock AuditDAO class. 
		   This not only makes testing easier but also independent of environmental changes as you are not using the actual implementation of AuditService.


	6. Favor Composition over Inheritance
		It is more natural and flexbile to build business-domain classes out of various components with and find a "has-a" relation 
		than trying to find family tree relation or "is-a" relation.
		One common drawback of using composition instead of inheritance is that methods being provided by individual components may have to be implemented in the derived type.
		
		> The Decorator design Pattern is one example of Favor Composition over Inheritance principle.
	
	7. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ("L" In SOLID)	
		Subtypes must be substitutable for supertype, i.e. methods or functions which use superclass type must be able to work with the object of subclass without any issue.
		If a class has more functionality, than the subclass might not support those functionality this violates LSP. 
		In other word derived class or subclass must enhance functionality, but not reduce them.
		
		i.e if you have a method in Super class and this method is implemented and introduce certain business logic  
		    and in the subclass, you decided to override this method with empty body or by throw Usupported Operation Exception 
			This design violates LSP.
	
		< LSP is closely related to the "Single Responsibility Principle" and "Interface Segregation Principle". > I DON"T AGREE WITH THAT
	
	8. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ("I" In SOLID)	 -> "The reason behind the existence of Java Functional & Marker Interfaces" 
		Means a client should not implement an interface if it will not use all methods introduced by that interface.
		That's why you can see a lot of Functional & Marker Interfaces in Java.
		
		Why we need Marker Interface In Java?
			Let's take the example of the Cloneable interface. If we try to clone an object that doesn't implement this interface, 
			the JVM throws a CloneNotSupportedException. 
			Hence, the Cloneable marker interface is an indicator to the JVM that we can call the Object.clone() method.
			
			In the same way, when calling the ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() method, 
			the JVM checks if the object implements the Serializable marker interface. When it's not the case, 
			a NotSerializableException is thrown. Therefore, the object isn't serialized to the output stream.
	
	9. Programming for Interface not implementation
		So use interface type on variables, return types of method or argument type of methods in Java.
		this will lead to flexible code that can work with any new implementation of the interface.
		Another way to implement "Open Closed Design Principle".
	
	10. Delegation principle
		Means Don't do all stuff by yourself, delegate it to the respective class. 
		The key benefit of this design principle is no duplication of code and pretty easy to modify behavior.
		
		Classical example of delegation design principle is equals() and hashCode() method in Java. In order to compare two objects for equality, 
		we ask the class itself to make comparison instead of the Client class doing that check.

		Event delegation is another example of this principle, where an event is delegated to Listners for handling. 

		> State & Strategy design patterns are example of Delegation principle
			In Strategy, the strategy class/interface delegates the implementation to the classes that will implement it.
			In State, Our context class (the class that has multiple states) is going to delegate the behavior to the state implementation.

Strategy Pattern > What problem is solved by the Strategy pattern in Java?
----------------
	Strategy design pattern is based upon Open Closed Design Principle.
	It's one of the popular pattern in the field of object-oriented analysis and design along with Decorator, Observer and Factory
	Strategy pattern allows you to encapsulate possible changes in a process and encapsulate that in a Strategy class.
	How?
		By doing that your process (mainly a method) depends upon a strategy, which is a higher level of abstraction than implementation. 
		This makes your process open for extension by providing new Strategy implementation, 
		but closed for modification, because the introduction of a new strategy doesn't require a change in a tested method.

	When to use: Strategy pattern is very useful, especially for implementing algorithmic strategy e.g. encryption, compression, comparison.
			Our varaities are determined by certain choices  
			such as we have only three types of message filtering in our problem (filter by type, by size, by content) 
			OR 
			If you see, your code needs to use different kind of related algorithms, then think of using Strategy pattern 
			i.e Sorting Algorithms: we need the client to choose between different kind of sorting algorithms and since
				sorting algorithms can be determined so we can use Strategy Pattern by think of it as each sorting algorithm 
				is a strategy.
	
	In Java:
		A couple of examples of Strategy pattern from JDK is Comparator and LayoutManager (GridLayout, BorderLayout).
		The Collections.sort() method which sorts the list of the object uses the Strategy pattern to compare objects. 
			Since every object uses a different comparison strategy you can compare various objects differently without changing the sort method.

	My Comment
		Since most of the time you will implement the Strategy Pattern using Functional Interface, we can say this pattern is a friend of 
		Java8 Lambda Expression

	
	Example:	
		In this example, we need to filter the Incoming message by certain criterion e.g. filter message if it's of a particular type. 
		But you know that this criterion can change, and you may need to filter the message by their size or a specific keyword in their content.
		By removing them from incoming List of Messages.
		
	Solution:
		We will define a Strategy interface say FilteringStrategy which contains isFilterable(Message msg) method, 
		this method returns true if Message passed to it is filterable by criteria, implemented by subclasses.
		
		We will build three implementations of this FilteringStrategy interface FilterByType, FilterBySize, and FilteryByKeyword.	
		And our data object Message contains a type, represented by Java Enum, an integer size, and String content.
		
		So the code that will use those 3 implementations and the Message class to do filtering using strategy pattern will be as follows:
		
		public class StrategyPattern { 
			private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(StrategyPattern.class); 
			public static void main(String args[]) { 
				List<Message> messages = new ArrayList<>(); 
				
				// preparing some data 
				messages.add(new Message(MessageType.TEXT, 100, "This is test message")); 
				messages.add(new Message(MessageType.XML, 200, "How are you ")); 
				messages.add(new Message(MessageType.TEXT, 300, "Does Strategy pattern follows OCP design principle?")); 
				messages.add(new Message(MessageType.TEXT, 400, "Wrong Message, should be filtered")); 
				
				// do filtering for messages 
				messages = filter(messages, new FilterByType(MessageType.XML)); 
				messages = filter(messages, new FilterByKeyword("Wrong")); 
				messages = filter(messages, new FilterBySize(200)); 
			}
			// you can provide any filtering criterion by providing implementation of FilteringStrategy, but no need to change any code here. 
			public static final List<Message> filter(List<Message> messageList, FilteringStrategy strategy){ 
				Iterator<Message> itr = messageList.iterator(); 
				while(itr.hasNext()){ 
					Message msg = itr.next(); 
					if(strategy.isFilterable(msg)){ 
						logger.info(strategy.toString() + msg); 
						itr.remove(); 
					} 
				} 
				return messageList; 
			} 
		}


https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2014/04/difference-between-state-and-strategy-design-pattern-java.html
State Pattern > What is the difference between State and Strategy Patterns?
-------------		
	State Pattern
	When to use: if you need to manage state and state transition, without lots of nested conditional statements, state pattern is the pattern to use.

	Although both are an example of applying OCP, and both have almost the same UML digram,
	- The most key Different is that, change in Strategy is done by Client, but Change in State can be done by Context or State object itself.
	- Another different is Order of State transition is well defined in State pattern, there is no such requirement for Strategy pattern. 
	  Client is free to choose any Strategy implementation of his choice.
	- In State pattern, individual state can contain reference of Context, to implement state transitions, 
	  but Strategy doesn't contain reference of Context, where they are used.

	Example:
		Imagine we have a "package" which is sent to a post office, the package itself can be "ordered", then "delivered" to a post office 
		and finally "received" by a client. 
		Now, depending on the actual state, we want to print its delivery status and we want to be able to swith from state to another.

		The simplest approach would be to add some boolean flags and apply simple if/else statements within each of our methods in the class. 
		That won't complicate it much in a simple scenario. However, it might complicate and pollute our code when we'll get more states to process 
		which will result in even more if/else statements and will break the OCP concept.
		Besides, all logic for each of the states would be spread across all methods. Now, this is where the State pattern might be considered to use.

		Our context, that's going to be a Package class and is going to delegate the behavior to the state implementation.
		
	Solution:
		public class Package {
			private PackageState state = new OrderedState(); // compose the order state to set the inital state for the Package, 
															 // you don't need this line in strategy pattern	
						
			// These 3 methods are delegating the job to the state object
			public void previousState() {
				state.prev(this);
			}
		 
			public void nextState() {
				state.next(this);
			}
		 
			public void printStatus() {
				state.printStatus();
			}
			
			// 
			public void setState(PackageState st) {
				if(st != null) state = st;
			}
		}
		
		public interface PackageState {
			void next(Package pkg);
			void prev(Package pkg);
			void printStatus();
		}
		// Implements "ordered" state but we still need to implement the other 2 states "delivered" and "received" states
		public class OrderedState implements PackageState {
			@Override
			public void next(Package pkg) {
				pkg.setState(new DeliveredState()); // Move from state to another by comoposition 
			}
		 
			@Override
			public void prev(Package pkg) {
				System.out.println("The package is in its root state.");
			}
		 
			@Override
			public void printStatus() {
				System.out.println("Package ordered, not delivered to the office yet.");
			}
		}
		
		//..... More code for other 2 states "delivered" and "received" states
		
		@Test
		public void givenNewPackage_whenPackageReceived_thenStateReceived() {
			Package pkg = new Package();
		 
			assertThat(pkg.getState(), instanceOf(OrderedState.class));
			pkg.nextState();
		 
			assertThat(pkg.getState(), instanceOf(DeliveredState.class));
			pkg.nextState();
		 
			assertThat(pkg.getState(), instanceOf(ReceivedState.class));
		}

https://www.java67.com/2013/07/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-real-life-example-tutorial.html
Decorator Pattern > Which OOP concept Decorator design Pattern is based upon?
------------------
	The decorator pattern takes advantage of Composition to provide a dynamic way of extending an object's functionality through Composition, 
	it adds new features without modifying the original class.
	
	When to use: Whenever you have undetermined number of strategies or prossibilities for certain method or implementation such as the price of 
			Sandwiches can be vary based on the extras that can be added to it and these extras has multiple varieties.	
	
	One disadvantage of Decorator pattern, it adds lots of small classes in the code base, remember the overwhelming number of classes in the java.io package. 
	Though, once you know that which classes are main classes, and which are decorators, you tend to get a better understanding of overall structure. 
	UML diagrams certain help in this case.
	
	In Java:
		A couple of classes from the java.io package like BufferedInputStream, LineNumberInputStream 

	Example:
		Do we need to create software for calculating the price for a Sandwich, Since the customer can customize a sandwich by asking extra cheese or extra fillings, 
		you also need to include the cost of those items in the final price of Sandwich. 
		Since this customization can vary a lot among different customers and offer from a shop, creating classes for different types of Sandwich with different fillings or extras
		This problem looks a natural fit for applying Decorator pattern because we have a base object Sandwich, which can be decorated with extra cheese and fillings.

		By using the Decorator pattern, you can extend the functionality of Sandwich class at runtime, based upon customer's request, 
		which is impossible with Inheritance until you have a specific class for every possible customer request. 

	Solution:
		We have an abstract class "Sandwich", with abstract method "price()"
		And a concrete implementation class "WhiteBreadSandwich".
		
		We have a Decorator abstract class, called "SandwichDecorator"
		And a concrete implementation of this as "CheeseDecorator"
		
		SandwichDecorator extends Sandwich, to be of the same type as the original object, which is getting decorated. 
		****This is a critical requirement of Decorator pattern so that a decorated object can stand in place of the original object like it 
		can be passed when a method expects the original object.

		Decorator adds functionality before or after delegating the task to the original object, which means in this example price of a WhilteBreadSandwich 
		with Cheese will be calculated by the first calculating price of WhiteBreadSandwich and then the price of Cheese. 

		Finally, I have a class called SandwichMaker, it will test the whole program and demonstrate how Decorator pattern adds new functionality on the fly at runtime. 

		****I have also used BigDecimal to represent money instead of double primitive to follow best practices suggested in Effective Java. 
		If you don't know why to read this Java mistake about using double to represent the price.
		
		public abstract class Sandwich {  // It can be an Interface 
			protected String description = "Sandwich"; 
			public String getDescription(){ return description; } 
			public abstract BigDecimal price(); 
		}
		
		public class WhiteBreadSandWich extends Sandwich { 
			public WhiteBreadSandWich(String desc){ description = desc; } 
			@Override 
			public BigDecimal price() { return new BigDecimal("3.0"); } 
		}
		
		public abstract class SandWichDecorator extends Sandwich { 
			@Override 
			public abstract BigDecimal price(); 
		}
		
		public class CheeseDecorator extends SandWichDecorator { 
			Sandwich currentSandwich; // Compose the Sandwich base class
			public CheeseDecorator(Sandwich sw){ currentSandwich = sw; } 
			@Override 
			public String getDescription(){ return currentSandwich.getDescription() + ", Cheese"; } 
			@Override 
			public BigDecimal price() { return currentSandwich.price().add(new BigDecimal("0.50")); } 
		}

		public class SandwichMaker {   
			public static void main(String args[]){			  
				Sandwich mySandwich = new WhiteBreadSandWich("White bread Sandwich");
				System.out.printf("Price of %s is $%.2f %n", mySandwich.getDescription(), 
															 mySandwich.price());
			   
				//adding extra cheese using Decorator Pattter
				mySandwich = new CheeseDecorator(mySandwich);
				System.out.printf("Price of %s is $%.2f %n", mySandwich.getDescription(), 
															 mySandwich.price());
			}
		}


https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2015/01/adapter-vs-decorator-vs-facade-vs-proxy-pattern-java.html
Decorator, Proxy, Adapter, Facade > What is the difference between Decorator, Proxy, Adapter, Facade pattern in Java?
-----------------------------------
	all of them use Composition and delegation to solve the problem.
	
	The Purpose:	
		Adapter let's two components working together, which wouldn't be working because of incompatible interfaces.
		Decorator pattern, adds new functionalities at runtime. It allows you to enrich the object, even after it's creation.
		Facade design pattern neither converts interfaces nor adds new functionality, instead, it just provides simpler interfaces.
		Proxy pattern is also quite similar to Decorator, but it's purpose is to control access of object.
			Proxy prevents client's to directly accessing object, instead it act as real object and can provide alternate behavior or forward request to original object.
	
	The Structure:
		The Adapter pattern wraps an interface, and delegates call to it.
		The Decorator wraps an object of target class (Sandwich) and implements behavior on top of that, but at the same time 
			it extends from a base decorator class which in turn extends from the base class of target class.
		Facade wraps one or more interface/class to provide a central interface, it just compose all objects of some complicated classes, 
			to act as a face layer which is easy to use and hide these complixity from the client.
			So the client delegats all the complixity to the Facade Class.
		Proxy Pattern also wraps Subject and delegates calls to it, to control access for Object 
			or doing some preparation steps before calling the actual implementation.
			i.e some sort of security, some sort of controlling on hide/display from rendering some controls on screen.
	
	Similarity & Differences from structure point of view
		Both Decorator and Proxy pattern are meant to stay in place of original object, that's why both Decorator and Proxy pattern "implements/extends"
		interface of real object. Because of this nature, a decorator and proxy can be passed to a method, which accepts original or real object.

		Both Adapter and Facade pattern can wrap multiple interfaces, 
		which is also a different than Decorator and Proxy pattern, because they tend to operate on one object.
	
	

	Proxy is most versatile pattern of all these, and it can be used in different ways like:
		Remote proxy for communicating with remote object, 
		Virtual proxy to control access of expensive object, 
		Protection proxy to provide access to object based on roles, 
		Caching proxy which can return cached object.

Singleton Pattern > When to use the Singleton design pattern in Java? (Creational)
------------------
	When we need just one instance of a class and want that to be globally available then you can use the Singleton pattern. 
	It's not free of cost though because it increases the coupling between classes and makes them hard to test.

	
Template Method Pattern > What is Template Method Design pattern?
------------------------
	In Template Method Design pattern, the template method should be declared as final to prevent overriding.		
	Template means Preset format like HTML templates which has a fixed preset format.
	Similarly in the template method pattern, 
		we have a preset structure method called template method which consists of steps. 
		This steps can be an abstract method(s) which will be implemented by its subclasses.
	
	Somthing like: 
		public abstract class ComputerBuilder {
			// ... ComputerParts composition code
		
			// Template Method
			public final Computer buildComputer() {
				addMotherboard();
				setupMotherboard();
				addProcessor();
				return new Computer(computerParts);
			}
			// Abstract methods as steps to build up a Computer
			public abstract void addMotherboard();
			public abstract void setupMotherboard();
			public abstract void addProcessor();		
		}
		
		// override step abstract methods
		public class StandardComputerBuilder extends ComputerBuilder {...}
	
		// then to use this above structure code 
		new StandardComputerBuilder()
		  .buildComputer();
		  .getComputerParts() // method that return a Map
		  .forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println("Part : " + k + " Value : " + v));
	
	When to use: if you have a problem that can be done in very well determined steps
				i.e Steps to build computer, Steps to build certain order (select items step, payment step, and gift wrap step - Optional step) 
				
	
	In Java:
		 java.util.AbstractList, or java.util.AbstractSet.
		 An example of a template method can be the addAll() method, although it's not explicitly defined as final.
		 
		 public boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c) {
			rangeCheckForAdd(index);
			boolean modified = false;
			for (E e : c) {
				add(index++, e); // step method
				modified = true;
			}
			return modified;
		}
		
		// Users only need to implement the add() method:
		public void add(int index, E element) {
			throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
		}
	
Builder Pattern > 
-----------------
	In Java:
		java.lang.StringBuilder#append() 
		java.lang.StringBuffe#append()
		
		StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder("Temp");
		String data = builder.append(1)
						.append(true)
						.append("friend")
						.toString();


	Let's understand the value from using this pattern by example
		Let say we have class user that has a lot of fields, the constructor that initialze all fields will be somthing like that
			public User (String firstName, String lastName, int age, String phone, String address){
				this.firstName = firstName;
				this.lastName = lastName;
				this.age = age;
				this.phone = phone;
				this.address = address;
			}
			But what if the number of the mandatory fields start to be changed 
			Now We need more constructors:
			public User (String firstName, String lastName, int age, String phone){ ... }
			public User (String firstName, String lastName, String phone, String address){ ...  }
			public User (String firstName, String lastName, int age){ ...   }
			public User (String firstName, String lastName){ ...    }
			
			We will need some more like above. Still can manage? Now let’s introduce our sixth attribute i.e. salary. Now it is problem.
			
			A sample implementation using Builder Pattern
			public class User {
				//All final attributes
				private final String firstName; // required
				private final String lastName; // required
				private final int age; // optional
				private final String phone; // optional
				private final String address; // optional
			 
				private User(UserBuilder builder) { // constructor is marked as private
					this.firstName = builder.firstName;
					this.lastName = builder.lastName;
					this.age = builder.age;
					this.phone = builder.phone;
					this.address = builder.address;
				}
			 
				//All getter, and NO setter to provde immutability
				public String getFirstName() {
					return firstName;
				}
				public String getLastName() {
					return lastName;
				}
				public int getAge() {
					return age;
				}
				public String getPhone() {
					return phone;
				}
				public String getAddress() {
					return address;
				}			
			 
				// Inner class
				public static class UserBuilder {
					private final String firstName;
					private final String lastName;
					private int age;
					private String phone;
					private String address;
			 
					// Constructor for manadatory fields
					public UserBuilder(String firstName, String lastName) {
						this.firstName = firstName;
						this.lastName = lastName;
					}
					
					// methods that set the other optional fields and yet return object from same class builder, so it can be chained
					public UserBuilder age(int age) {
						this.age = age;
						return this;
					}
					public UserBuilder phone(String phone) {
						this.phone = phone;
						return this;
					}
					public UserBuilder address(String address) {
						this.address = address;
						return this;
					}
					//Return the finally consrcuted User object
					public User build() {
						User user =  new User(this);
						validateUserObject(user);
						return user;
					}
					private void validateUserObject(User user) {
						//Do some basic validations to check 
						//if user object does not break any assumption of system
					}
				}
			}
			
			Usage:
			User user1 = new User.UserBuilder("Lokesh", "Gupta")
								.age(30)
								.phone("1234567")
								.address("Fake address 1234")
								.build();

-----------------
	Flyweight, 		 
			I used Flyweight when I was handling the WorkFlow from the process engin which is another class and because of the WorFlow structure and data are saved
			as XML file in the database, so at certain point I need to get this xml from database, then I saved it in the Map collection
			Then by using JAXB to generate the corresponding objects from this xml, so the process engin can deal with the regular objects
			representing the structure of current workflow as well as the settings in this workflow.
